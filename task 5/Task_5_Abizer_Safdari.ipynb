another moment down went Alice after it never once considering how \\nipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stop\\nrds as she fell past it Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this\\nusand miles down I think for you see Alice had learnt several things of this so\\nhat Latitude or Longitude Ive got to Alice had no idea what Latitude was or Lon\\ndown There was nothing else to do so Alice soon began talking again Dinahll mis\\nt do cats eat bats I wonder And here Alice began to get rather sleepy and went \\nand dry leaves and the fall was over Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up\\nas not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind and was just in time t\\nll but they were all locked and when Alice had been all the way down one side a\\nk and to her great delight it fitted Alice opened the door and found that it le\\ny head would go through thought poor Alice it would be of very little use witho\\neway things had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few thi\\nh certainly was not here before said Alice and round the neck of the bottle was\\n to say Drink me but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurr\\nis bottle was _not_ marked poison so Alice ventured to taste it and finding it \\nd it off What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up like a telesco\\n this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my going out altogethe\\nthe garden at once but alas for poor Alice when she got to the door she found s\\neres no use in crying like that said Alice to herself rather sharply I advise y\\nople But its no use now thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people Why ther\\nked in currants Well Ill eat it said Alice and if it makes me grow larger I can\\nrally happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of expe\\n Tears Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much surprised that for t\\nanbut I must be kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the way I \\n hurried off to the garden door Poor Alice It was as much as she could do lying\\nought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great girl like you she might well\\nhe be savage if Ive kept her waiting Alice felt so desperate that she was ready\\n the darkness as hard as he could go Alice took up the fan and gloves and as th\\nse are not the

Would it be of any use now thought Alice to speak to this mouse Everything is\\ntired of swimming about here O Mouse Alice thought this must be the right way o\\nit doesnt understand English thought Alice I daresay its a French mouse come ov\\nor with all her knowledge of history Alice had no very clear notion how long ag\\nth fright Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the\\nif you were me Well perhaps not said Alice in a soothing tone dont be angry abo\\ne her She is such a dear quiet thing Alice went on half to herself as she swam \\nching miceoh I beg your pardon cried Alice again for this time the Mouse was br\\nar the name again I wont indeed said Alice in a great hurry to change the subje\\nfof dogs The Mouse did not answer so Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice\\n kills all the rats andoh dear cried Alice in a sorrowful tone Im afraid Ive of\\nits face was quite pale with passion Alice thought and it said in a low trembli\\n and several other curious creatures Alice led the way and the whole party swam\\nw minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly w\\nan you and must know better and this Alice would not allow without knowing how \\nge ring with the Mouse in the middle Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it \\n now my dear it continued turning to Alice as it spoke As wet as ever said Alic\\nlice as it spoke As wet as ever said Alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem \\nucusrace What _is_ a Caucusrace said Alice not that she wanted much to know but\\n of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with one finger and the whole party \\n out in a confused way Prizes Prizes Alice had no idea what to do and in despai\\nin your pocket he went on turning to Alice Only a thimble said Alice sadly Hand\\nturning to Alice Only a thimble said Alice sadly Hand it over here said the Dod\\nd this short speech they all cheered Alice thought the whole thing very absurd \\no tell me your history you know said Alice and why it is you hateC and D she ad\\na sad tale said the Mouse turning to Alice and sighing It _is_ a long tail cert\\ng It _is_ a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with wonder at the Mous\\n are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely What are you thinking of I \\nu thinking of I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth\\nsharply and very angrily A knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful \\nonsense I didnt mean it pleaded poor Alice But youre so easily offended you kno\\nease come back and finish

she was always r\\nious pretexts they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone I wish I hadnt m\\n ever see you any more And here poor Alice began to cry again for she felt very\\ne _can_ I have dropped them I wonder Alice guessed in a moment that it was look\\npletely Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about and called\\nir of gloves and a fan Quick now And Alice was so much frightened that she ran \\nhe fan and gloves How queer it seems Alice said to herself to be going messages\\nsort of thing that would happen Miss Alice Come here directly and get ready for\\nuse doesnt get out Only I dont think Alice went on that theyd let Dinah stop in\\nWhat _will_ become of me Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had \\nmuch pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one wasnt always growing larger\\n up any more _here_ But then thought Alice shall I _never_ get any older than I\\n shouldnt like _that_ Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself How can you lea\\nttle pattering of feet on the stairs Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to loo\\nnst it that attempt proved a failure Alice heard it say to itself Then Ill go r\\nt the window _That_ you wont thought Alice and after waiting till she fancied s\\nre was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers now and the\\ncucumberframes there must be thought Alice I wonder what

said the Rabbits voice and Alice called out as loud as she could If y\\nere was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to herself I wonder what the\\nwo they began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A barrowful wil\\nn with A barrowful of _what_ thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for th\\n which produced another dead silence Alice noticed with some surprise that the

said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard\\nck and made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle to kee\\n in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very like having a g\\n great eyes half shut This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her es\\nwhat a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she leant against a buttercup to \\nhe great question certainly was what Alice looked all round her at the flowers \\nom a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time i\\ncouraging opening for a conversation Alice replied rather shyly II hardly know \\n explain _myself_ Im afraid sir said Alice because Im not myself you see I dont\\nIm afraid I cant put it more clearly Alice replied very politely for I cant und\\nhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice but when you have to turn into a chr\\n your feelings may be different said Alice all I know is it would feel very que\\nto the beginning of the conversation Alice felt a little irritated at the Cater\\nwas another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any good reason a\\nsay This sounded promising certainly Alice turned and came back again Keep your\\naid the Caterpillar Is that all said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as\\nas she could No said the Caterpillar Alice thought she might as well wait as sh\\nanged do you Im afraid I am sir said Alice I cant remember things as I usedand \\ne busy bee but it all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice R\\nFather William_ said the Caterpillar Alice folded her hands and began You are o\\nlar Not _quite_ right Im afraid said Alice timidly some of the words have got a\\nsked Oh Im not particular as to size Alice hastily replied only one doesnt like\\nw I _dont_ know said the Caterpillar Alice said nothing she had never been so m\\n larger sir if you wouldnt mind said Alice three inches is such a wretched heig\\nh But Im not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a

another moment it was out of sight Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the\\n bit Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of delight which changed i\\nt _can_ all that green stuff be said Alice And where _have_ my shoulders got to\\nd the Pigeon Im _not_ a serpent said Alice indignantly Let me alone Serpent I s\\nt idea what youre talking about said Alice Ive tried the roots of trees

down again into its nest Alice crouched down among the trees as wel\\neet high Whoever lives there thought Alice itll never do to come upon them _thi\\nge eyes like a frog and both footmen Alice noticed had powdered hair that curle\\nd their curls got entangled together Alice laughed so much at this that she had\\noor staring stupidly up into the sky Alice went timidly up to the door and

very politely feeling quite ple\\nch said the Duchess and thats a fact Alice did not at all like the tone of this\\n_please_ mind what youre doing cried Alice jumping up and down in an agony of t\\nich would _not_ be an advantage said Alice who felt very glad to get an opportu\\ns said the Duchess chop off her head Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook\\nthe poor little thing howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words I speak \\n bit if you like the Duchess said to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spok\\n she went out but it just missed her Alice caught the baby with some difficulty\\nections just like a starfish thought Alice The poor little thing was snorting l\\ntake this child away with me thought Alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or t\\nneezing by this time Dont grunt said Alice thats not at all a proper way of exp\\n yourself The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into its face \\nxtremely small for a baby altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing a\\noing to turn into a pig my dear said Alice seriously Ill have nothing more to d\\ney went on for some while in silence Alice was just beginning to think to herse\\noff The

Then it doesnt matter which way you \\nthe Cat so long as I get _somewhere_ Alice added as an explanation Oh youre sur\\nthe Cat if you only walk long enough Alice felt that this could not be denied
